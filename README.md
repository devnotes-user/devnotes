# devnotes

DevNotes is a tool for breaking down knowledge silos. DevNotes can help eliminate situations where only a small subset of a group of developer's know how a feature works or is implemented. Users can create tasks and notes to track vital implementation details of a project, or record issues that other developers need to watch for. Once tasks and notes have been created, other developers on that project can then perform queries on them to gain insight into how a project is implemented.

## Prerelease
DevNotes is currently in a prerelease state, meaning potential users won't be able to use it as intended. A list of task that need to be accomplished to produce the first release candidate can be viewed in the Projects section of this repository on Github.
